Algorithim
---------------
The alogritim is very simiar to the value stored in the positive data type. The only difference is the number are receprocated ( 0 is translated to 1 and vice vice versa after the first non zero digit.
For eg -5 is stored in unsigned character 8 bits as 11111011 and positive 5 is stored as 00000101

If the value of the number to be stored is greater than the number of bits that the value stored is the max value based on the data type ( e.g unassigned character is 65536) minus the actual number. For the negative number the bit values are transposed affter the first non zero digit.
For e.g -65537 will be stored in a unassigned character as 11111111 and positive 65536 is stored as 00000001
