Algorithim
---------------
The alogritim is to use bits of the data type ( e.g short integer is 16 bits) to store the number.The right most bit is 2^0, the next 2^1, 2^2 and so on ....
The value of each of this bits is added to retrive the desired number.
For eg 5 is stored in unsigned character 8 bits as 00000101

If the value of the number to be stored is greater than the number of bits that the value stored is the max value based on the data type ( e.g unassigned character is 65536) minus the actual number.
For e.g 65537 will be stored in a unassigned character as 00000001
